# Offline editing

## Web application

**[MakeCode](@homeurl@)** is an **HTML5 web application** that's automatically cached locally when first viewed in your browser. After the web app is loaded and once the code blocks have compiled for the **first** time, you will have everything you need to continue working without an internet connection. This is true for the all of the blocks you see in the editor when it's first loaded. If you decide to add a [package](/packages), it's possible that you'll again need to connect to the internet to allow the code in the new package to compile.

## Hosting MakeCode locally

More experienced users can download the entire [PXT Toolchain](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt) and use the [command line interface](/cli) (CLI) to compile and deploy your scripts locally. PXT provides a great out-of-the-box experience using [Visual Studio Code](/code), a lightweight cross-platform code editor. See the @githubUrl@ project page for instructions on setting up a MakeCode local server.
